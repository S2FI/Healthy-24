A simple landing page developped with react typescript and sass.
The project successfully utilized the Sass module to improve the structure and maintainability of stylesheets. By leveraging Sass features such as variables, mixins, and nesting, the project achieved cleaner and more organized code.

The decision to omit Redux was driven by the absence of requirements necessitating its adoption. This led to a streamlined development process, improved performance, and reduced complexity. However, it is important to reassess this decision if future project requirements or feature additions may demand a more robust state management solution.

By employing Sass and selectively adopting technologies like Redux, the project exemplifies a pragmatic approach to enhancing code maintainability and efficiency while balancing the project's specific needs.
